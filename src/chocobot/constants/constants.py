**How do I use Matrix Enchanting?**
You can generate \"enchantment pieces\" using XP and Lapis and place them on a grid. Two pieces of the same type can be merged to upgrade the piece\'s level by placing one piece on top of the other. You can influence what kind of pieces you get using candles.

**Why can't I take my item out?**
Either you have incompatible enchantments (like Fortune/Silk Touch) or you have two of the same enchantments on the table. For the latter, remember that you can combine same-enchantment blocks to upgrade them.

**How do bookshelves influence Matrix Enchanting?**
Bookshelves increases the maximum amount of "blocks" you can create.

**What is candle influencing?**
Different coloured candles can influence the likelihood of an enchantment being rolled. For specific information, use `!candles`'''
